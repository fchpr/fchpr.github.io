{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/next.js/\" target=\"_blank\">Next.js</a> is a React framework from <a href=\"'https://zeit.co\">Zeit</a>, and is the inspiration for Sapper. There are a few notable differences, however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#39;s powered by <a href=\"https://svelte.dev\" target=\"_blank\">Svelte</a> instead of React, so it&#39;s faster and your apps are smaller</li>\n<li>Instead of route masking, we encode route parameters in filenames. For example, the page you&#39;re looking at right now is <code>routes/blog/[slug].svelte</code></li>\n<li>As well as pages (Svelte components, which render on server or client), you can create <em>server routes</em> in your <code>routes</code> directory. These are just <code>.js</code> files that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods, and receive Express <code>request</code> and <code>response</code> objects as arguments. This makes it very easy to, for example, add a JSON API such as the one <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/blog/how-is-sapper-different-from-next.json\" target=\"_blank\">powering this very blog</a></li>\n<li>Links are just <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, rather than framework-specific `<Link> components. That means, for example, that <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/blog/how-can-i-get-involved\" target=\"_blank\">this link right here</a>, despite being inside a blob of HTML, works with the router as you&#39;d expect</li>\n</ul>\n","metadata":{"date":"2019-04-23T18:59:17.082Z","title":"How is Sapper different from Next.js?","pubdate":"2019-04-23","dateString":"Tue Apr 23 2019"},"slug":"how_is_sapper_different_from_next-js"}
